# CREATE AN ANNIMATED CARD
## Instructions
### 1. Planning
Think about what kind of card you want to make and who you'll make it for.
On a piece of paper plan out your card.
- Who will your card be for?
- What will it be about?
- What text will be on the outside and on the inside?
- What kinds of sprites or backgrounds will you include?

### 2. The Text
- Create a text sprite for the messages on your card.
- Make sure to create 2 costumes, one for the outside and the other for the inside of the card.
*Use the costume editor to change the text on the outside and inside of your card.*
- Give each costume a name.
